# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

# WTWR (What to Wear?) – Back End

This is the back-end part of the WTWR app.  
It creates a server that stores data about users and clothing items.  
The server also has routes (API endpoints) that let you create, read, update, and delete data.

## What I Learned

- How to set up a server with **Node.js** and **Express.js**
- How to connect a server to a **MongoDB** database using **Mongoose**
- How to make and use a **REST API**
- How to handle errors (like invalid IDs or missing data)
- How to use **Git** and **GitHub** for version control

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** – runs JavaScript on the server
- **Express.js** – helps build the server and routes
- **MongoDB** – database for storing data
- **Mongoose** – makes it easier to work with MongoDB
- **Nodemon** – restarts the server automatically during development
